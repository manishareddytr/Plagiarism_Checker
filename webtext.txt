<p><span class="xn-location">MUMBAI</span> and <span class="xn-location">STONY BROOK, New York</span>, <span class="xn-chron">February 27, 2018</span> /PRNewswire/ --</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Collaboration to help thwart counterfeits with molecular tagging of capsules</i>Â </p>
<p>Applied DNA Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ: APDN) ("Applied DNA" or the "Company"), and ACG have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) that will allow ACG to utilize Applied DNA's proven SigNatureÂ® molecular tagging and authentication technologies to develop molecularly tagged empty hard-shell capsules for offering to ACG's customers to enhance product traceability and authentication. The MoU is expected to be followed by a definitive agreement.</p>
<p>Â Â Â Â  (Logo: <a href="https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/640402/ACG_Logo.jpg" rel="nofollow">https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/640402/ACG_Logo.jpg</a> )<br />
</p>
<p>The empty capsulesÂ <a href="https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/PressReleases/empty-capsules.asp" rel="nofollow">market</a>Â witnessed healthy growth during the last decade and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 7.2% between 2016 and 2021 to reach <span class="xn-money">USD 2.13 billion</span> by 2021.Â </p>
<p>The development of molecularly tagged empty hard-shell capsules will allow ACG's customers to enhance every distribution channel's integrity. It will also provide pharmaceutical companies with increased and assured capabilities when investigating suspected counterfeit medicines and help enhance patient and regulator confidence in pharmaceutical companies and their supply chains.</p>
<p>Applied DNA's SigNature technology allows the embedding of a bespoke molecular tag into one or more capsule component materials. Each customer's molecular tag can be formulated to specifically adhere tenaciously to a wide variety of substrates and is optimized to allow for authentication at any point in the pharmaceutical supply chain.</p>
<p>On the association between ACG and Applied DNA, Mr. <span class="xn-person">Selwyn Noronha</span>, CEO, <span class="xn-person">ACG Capsules</span> said, "With the increasing threat of counterfeits in the pharmaceutical supply chain and regulations mandating companies to deploy strategies such as serialization and to have greater awareness, there is a need for innovative and effective solutions for product authentication, track and trace and supply chain integrity. We strongly believe that our association with Applied DNA is a step towards nipping the counterfeiting problem that is grappling the industry today. With the introduction of stricter regulatory norms and measures across the globe, the pressure lies increasingly in improving existing supply chain safeguards. The association will equip pharmaceutical companies with greater capabilities to thwart the threat of counterfeits by providing amplified traceability solution across the supply chain."</p>
<p>Elaborating on the association, Dr. <span class="xn-person">James Hayward</span>, president and CEO of Applied DNA said, "We are proud to announce the signing of the MoU and are excited by ACG's development of on-dose authentication for hard-shell capsules powered by the Company's SigNature molecular tagging and authentication technologies. The ability to forensically test a capsule in the field and quickly prove its provenance is a powerful tool for all nodes of the pharmaceutical supply chain and will ensure a more secure and traceable global pharmaceutical supply chain."</p>

<p>GURGAON, <span class="xn-location">India</span>, <span class="xn-chron">February 26, 2018</span> /PRNewswire/ --</p>
<p>- A four-year-old Uzbek child suffering from a deadly brain tumor visited <span class="xn-location">India</span> after remaining untreated at hospitals in <span class="xn-location">Germany</span> and <span class="xn-location">Russia</span></p>
<p>- Given the intensive double surgeries that required absolute precision, <a href="https://www.parashospitals.com/doctors/paras-hospital-gurgaon-dr-vs-mehta-neurosurgery-brain-tumor-india/" rel="nofollow">Dr. (Prof) V.S Mehta</a>, Chairman Neurosciences at Paras Hospitals, Gurgaon, and his team eliminated the double-sided tumor</p>
<p>A leading neurosurgery team of Delhi NCR successfully treated a complicated brain tumor of a four-year-old child from <span class="xn-location">Uzbekistan</span>. The neurosurgeons at Paras Hospitals, Gurgaon under the guidance of Dr. (Prof.) VS Mehta, Chairman Neurosciences, Paras Healthcare, Paras Gurugram, performed surgical intervention using the latest image-guided brain tumor technology.</p>
<p>Â Â Â Â  (Logo: <a href="http://mma.prnewswire.com/media/582327/Paras_Hospitals_Logo.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://mma.prnewswire.com/media/582327/Paras_Hospitals_Logo.jpg</a> )<br />
Â Â Â Â  (Photo: <a href="https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/645975/Paras_Hospital_Arnella_Khachaturyan.jpg" rel="nofollow">https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/645975/Paras_Hospital_Arnella_Khachaturyan.jpg</a> )</p>
<p>In the month of April last year, four-year-old <span class="xn-person">Arnella Khachaturyan</span> fainted in her kindergarten class suffering from a right side paralysis. The brain tumor was detected by the doctors in <span class="xn-location">Tashkent</span>. In search of optimum treatment for their little daughter, the parents met doctors at <span class="xn-location">Russia</span> and <span class="xn-location">Germany</span> but were not able to attain any definitive solution, before they came to <span class="xn-location">India</span> for treatment. In <span class="xn-location">India</span>, they also visited many private hospitals and were advised various treatments including chemotherapy and radiotherapy but were against the suggestion of surgery. The parents chose to undergo radiotherapy at a private hospital in <span class="xn-location">India</span>. The child, however, continued to deteriorate after radiotherapy.</p>
<p>In search of a definitive treatment for their daughter, they met <a href="https://www.parashospitals.com/doctors/paras-hospital-gurgaon-dr-vs-mehta-neurosurgery-brain-tumor-india/" rel="nofollow">Dr. (Prof.) V.S Mehta, Chairman Neurosciences, Paras Healthcare</a> and their team from <a href="https://www.parashospitals.com/" rel="nofollow">Paras Hospitals, Gurgaon</a>, where they advised surgery and after several discussions and counselling, the parents agreed to a surgery.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.parashospitals.com/doctors/paras-hospital-gurgaon-dr-vs-mehta-neurosurgery-brain-tumor-india/" rel="nofollow">Dr.(Prof.) V.S Mehta, Chairman Neurosciences, Paras Healthcare</a><b>, </b> said,Â "It was a rare case, brain stem glioma and requires delicate analysis of the situation. After diagnosis, the child had two separate tumors in the brain stem. We concluded that a double surgery was the only option. We initially removed the right side tumor and after three months Arnella had to be operated again to remove the tumor situated on the left side of the brain stem. The case was critical and has not been performed in <span class="xn-location">India</span> that often. Biopsy of the tumor was also favorable to the child and is likely to have a good long-term prognosis."</p>
<p>The brainstem is the posterior part of the brain, adjoining and structurally continuous with the spinal cord. Though small, this is an extremely important part of the brain as it controls the flow of messages between the brain and the rest of the body, and it also controls basic body functions such as breathing, swallowing, heart rate, blood pressure, consciousness, and whether one is awake or sleepy. As all the nerves going to the body passes through this small structure, even fraction of millimeter injury can produce major neurological deficits.</p>
<p>A brainstem glioma is a cancerous tumor in the brainstem. Around 75% are diagnosed in children and young adults under the age of 20 but have been known to affect older adults as well. This tumor is not operated upon by most neurosurgeons in the world and only selected neurosurgeons operate on selected cases of the brain stem. <a href="https://www.parashospitals.com/doctors/paras-hospital-gurgaon-dr-vs-mehta-neurosurgery-brain-tumor-india/" rel="nofollow">Dr. Mehta</a> is one of the neurosurgeons who has a vast experience of operating brain stem in the world.</p>
<p><span class="xn-location">India</span> is globally becoming famous for providing quality treatment, and yet again, another parents' search across continents was happily addressed by the doctors in <span class="xn-location">India</span>.</p>

<div class="xn-content">
<p><span class="xn-location">MUMBAI</span>, <span class="xn-chron">February 24, 2018</span> /PRNewswire/ --</p>
<p>Today, an innovative initiativeÂ <b>'</b><b>ImpactFirst </b> <b>-</b><b> Prioritizing Lives in Philanthropy</b><b>'</b> was launched by Dasra, a strategic philanthropy organization, to enable adoption of a mindset that puts actual lives at the forefront of philanthropic work. The launch was during Dasra Philanthropy Week 2018 that brought together Philanthropists, NGOs, Government, Foundations, Corporates, and Development Sector Experts. Some of the key thought-leaders present in the room were <span class="xn-person">Peggy Dulany</span> (Synergos Institute), <span class="xn-person">Kaku Nakhate</span> (Bank of America Merrill Lynch), <span class="xn-person">Amit Chandra</span> (Bain Capital), <span class="xn-person">Roopa Kudva</span> (Omidyar Network), <span class="xn-person">Ananth Padmanabhan</span> (Azim Premji Philanthropic Institute), among others. Â </p>
<p>Through ImpactFirst, Dasra aims to inspire accountability and foster convergence between key stakeholders, towards achieving measurable outcomes such as the Sustainable Development Goals.</p>
<p><i>"</i><i><span class="xn-location">India</span> is committed to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. While we are moving in the right direction, the magnitude of <span class="xn-location">India</span></i><i>'</i><i>s problems call for all of us - funders, NGOs, experts and the Government</i><i>-</i><i> to urgently collaborate and jointly invest in solutions that work,</i><i>"</i><i> said</i>Â <b><i><span class="xn-person">Neera Nundy</span>, Co-founder, Dasra.</i></b>Â </p>
<p style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">Why ImpactFirst? Why Now?</p>
<p>- <span class="xn-location">India</span> ranks #1 in adolescent pregnancies worldwide; delaying adolescent pregnancy could add 12% or <span class="xn-money">USD 400 billion</span> to <span class="xn-location">India's</span> GDP<br />
- Only 47% of girls are enrolled in secondary school; each additional year of schooling for girls reduces infant mortality for their offspring by up to 10%<br />
- Workforce participation rate for Indian women is at 29%, which is far less than that of comparable economies such as <span class="xn-location">China</span> (70%), the US (66%), or <span class="xn-location">Brazil</span> (65%); <span class="xn-money">USD 56 billion</span> can be added each year to <span class="xn-location">India's</span> economy by bringing girls into the workforce<br />
- 38% of under-fives (approx. <span class="xn-money">48m</span> children) are stunted in <span class="xn-location">India</span>. Moving away from malnutrition, will add <span class="xn-money">USD 12 billion</span> a year to <span class="xn-location">India's</span> economy in terms of productivity and lower healthcare expenditure<br />
- Good news is that 95% children are now attending primary school, 88% are attending secondary school and 63% are attending senior secondary school. The numbers only increase as each year passes. However, there is a fair amount of deficit in learning outcomes</p>
<p>Considering its size and population, <span class="xn-location">India</span> has a critical role to play in achieving the SDGs. If <span class="xn-location">India</span> does not achieve these, the world will also be unable to do so. However, despite the billions of dollars that have been invested in the development sector so far, <span class="xn-location">India</span> has a long way to go for better health, education and nutrition inÂ the country. The seriousness, scale and complexity of <span class="xn-location">India's</span> problems - from rising inequality to climate change - call for collaborative action and to invest in outcome-led solutions to transform lives.</p>
<p><i>"</i><i>For us, ImpactFirst encompasses putting the interest of society as a whole in front of your own personal aspirations. Whether you are an NGO, funder, or the government </i> <i>-</i><i> push the conversation, push the agenda, and push for us to be able to hold ourselves accountable. Keep asking yourself </i> <i>-</i><i> how much am I actually changing lives?</i><i>"</i><i> said</i>Â <b><i><span class="xn-person">Deval Sanghavi</span>, </i></b> <b><i>C</i></b><b><i>o-founder, Dasra</i></b><b><i>.</i></b>Â </p>
<p><b><i>What does it mean to be ImpactFirst?</i></b>Â </p>
<p>- Putting actual lives at the forefront of conversations, strategy, planning, action and collaboration<br />
- Being problem solvers, data analysts and agents of change<br />
- Defining exactly what problemÂ one wants to solve, and mapping out howÂ one will go about solving it<br />
- Willingness to be a first mover in areas that may be considered risky or challenging and looking for new approaches to old problems<br />
- HoldingÂ oneself accountable to high standards of measuring effectiveness and success<br />
- Realizing that changing lives is a long-term investment<br />
- It implies urgency to be catalytic in one's approach to funding, programming and strategy</p>
<p>Although the nature and scale of the commitment may differ greatly for each stakeholder, they share the same mindset. They dream of an <span class="xn-location">India</span> where every individual has the opportunity to realize their potential. It is the empathy and powerful intent of each of the stakeholders that will together driveÂ to transform lives.</p>
<p>To reinforce Dasra's ImpactFirst approach, four knowledge products have been launched during the Dasra Philanthropy Week 2018.</p>
<p><b>India Philanthropy Report 2018</b>Â </p>
<p>On this day, eighth edition of Bain India Philanthropy Report 2018 was released. The report explores how philanthropists can give more effectively to optimize the impact of their giving. What's worth noting is that philanthropists profiled in this report are relatively newer to philanthropy than those showcased in the 2017 report. The report features in-depth interviews with more than 30 philanthropists, and reveals four key mindsets, which if embraced, can help givers realize their full philanthropic potential. The report marks an inspiring stage for philanthropy in <span class="xn-location">India</span>, where an increasing number of philanthropists are joining the cadre of structured and strategic philanthropy, irrespective of their quantum of giving.</p>

<p><b>Collaborative Force: Empowering 10 to 19</b>Â </p>
<p>The white paper, titled Collaborative Force: Empowering 10 to 19, urges for adaptation of collaborative models to address <span class="xn-location">India's</span> large-scale development challenges.

<p>GURGAON, <span class="xn-location">India</span>, <span class="xn-chron">February 26, 2018</span> /PRNewswire/ --</p>
<p>- A four-year-old Uzbek child suffering from a deadly brain tumor visited <span class="xn-location">India</span> after remaining untreated at hospitals in <span class="xn-location">Germany</span> and <span class="xn-location">Russia</span></p>
<p>- Given the intensive double surgeries that required absolute precision, <a href="https://www.parashospitals.com/doctors/paras-hospital-gurgaon-dr-vs-mehta-neurosurgery-brain-tumor-india/" rel="nofollow">Dr. (Prof) V.S Mehta</a>, Chairman Neurosciences at Paras Hospitals, Gurgaon, and his team eliminated the double-sided tumor</p>
<p>A leading neurosurgery team of Delhi NCR successfully treated a complicated brain tumor of a four-year-old child from <span class="xn-location">Uzbekistan</span>. The neurosurgeons at Paras Hospitals, Gurgaon under the guidance of Dr. (Prof.) VS Mehta, Chairman Neurosciences, Paras Healthcare, Paras Gurugram, performed surgical intervention using the latest image-guided brain tumor technology.</p>
<p>Â Â Â Â  (Logo: <a href="http://mma.prnewswire.com/media/582327/Paras_Hospitals_Logo.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://mma.prnewswire.com/media/582327/Paras_Hospitals_Logo.jpg</a> )<br />

<p>In the month of April last year, four-year-old <span class="xn-person">Arnella Khachaturyan</span> fainted in her kindergarten class suffering from a right side paralysis. The brain tumor was detected by the doctors in <span class="xn-location">Tashkent</span>. In search of optimum treatment for their little daughter, the parents met doctors at <span class="xn-location">Russia</span> and <span class="xn-location">Germany</span> but were not able to attain any definitive solution, before they came to <span class="xn-location">India</span> for treatment. In <span class="xn-location">India</span>, they also visited many private hospitals and were advised various treatments including chemotherapy and radiotherapy but were against the suggestion of surgery. The parents chose to undergo radiotherapy at a private hospital in <span class="xn-location">India</span>. The child, however, continued to deteriorate after radiotherapy.</p>
<p>In search of a definitive treatment for their daughter, they met <a href="https://www.parashospitals.com/doctors/paras-hospital-gurgaon-dr-vs-mehta-neurosurgery-brain-tumor-india/" rel="nofollow">Dr. (Prof.) V.S Mehta, Chairman Neurosciences, Paras Healthcare</a> and their team from <a href="https://www.parashospitals.com/" rel="nofollow">Paras Hospitals, Gurgaon</a>, where they advised surgery and after several discussions and counselling, the parents agreed to a surgery.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.parashospitals.com/doctors/paras-hospital-gurgaon-dr-vs-mehta-neurosurgery-brain-tumor-india/" rel="nofollow">Dr.(Prof.) V.S Mehta, Chairman Neurosciences, Paras Healthcare</a><b>, </b> said,Â "It was a rare case, brain stem glioma and requires delicate analysis of the situation. After diagnosis, the child had two separate tumors in the brain stem. We concluded that a double surgery was the only option. We initially removed the right side tumor and after three months Arnella had to be operated again to remove the tumor situated on the left side of the brain stem. The case was critical and has not been performed in <span class="xn-location">India</span> that often. Biopsy of the tumor was also favorable to the child and is likely to have a good long-term prognosis."</p>
<p>The brainstem is the posterior part of the brain, adjoining and structurally continuous with the spinal cord. Though small, this is an extremely important part of the brain as it controls the flow of messages between the brain and the rest of the body, and it also controls basic body functions such as breathing, swallowing, heart rate, blood pressure, consciousness, and whether one is awake or sleepy. As all the nerves going to the body passes through this small structure, even fraction of millimeter injury can produce major neurological deficits.</p>
<p>A brainstem glioma is a cancerous tumor in the brainstem. Around 75% are diagnosed in children and young adults under the age of 20 but have been known to affect older adults as well. This tumor is not operated upon by most neurosurgeons in the world and only selected neurosurgeons operate on selected cases of the brain stem. <a href="https://www.parashospitals.com/doctors/paras-hospital-gurgaon-dr-vs-mehta-neurosurgery-brain-tumor-india/" rel="nofollow">Dr. Mehta</a> is one of the neurosurgeons who has a vast experience of operating brain stem in the world.</p>
<p><span class="xn-location">India</span> is globally becoming famous for providing quality treatment, and yet again, another parents' search across continents was happily addressed by the doctors in <span class="xn-location">India</span>.</p>

<div class="xn-content">
<p><span class="xn-location">MUMBAI</span>, <span class="xn-chron">February 24, 2018</span> /PRNewswire/ --</p>
<p>Today, an innovative initiativeÂ <b>'</b><b>ImpactFirst </b> <b>-</b><b> Prioritizing Lives in Philanthropy</b><b>'</b> was launched by Dasra, a strategic philanthropy organization, to enable adoption of a mindset that puts actual lives at the forefront of philanthropic work. The launch was during Dasra Philanthropy Week 2018 that brought together Philanthropists, NGOs, Government, Foundations, Corporates, and Development Sector Experts. Some of the key thought-leaders present in the room were <span class="xn-person">Peggy Dulany</span> (Synergos Institute), <span class="xn-person">Kaku Nakhate</span> (Bank of America Merrill Lynch), <span class="xn-person">Amit Chandra</span> (Bain Capital), <span class="xn-person">Roopa Kudva</span> (Omidyar Network), <span class="xn-person">Ananth Padmanabhan</span> (Azim Premji Philanthropic Institute), among others. Â </p>
<p>Through ImpactFirst, Dasra aims to inspire accountability and foster convergence between key stakeholders, towards achieving measurable outcomes such as the Sustainable Development Goals.</p>
<p><i>"</i><i><span class="xn-location">India</span> is committed to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. While we are moving in the right direction, the magnitude of <span class="xn-location">India</span></i><i>'</i><i>s problems call for all of us - funders, NGOs, experts and the Government</i><i>-</i><i> to urgently collaborate and jointly invest in solutions that work,</i><i>"</i><i> said</i>Â <b><i><span class="xn-person">Neera Nundy</span>, Co-founder, Dasra.</i></b>Â </p>
<p style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">Why ImpactFirst? Why Now?</p>
<p>- <span class="xn-location">India</span> ranks #1 in adolescent pregnancies worldwide; delaying adolescent pregnancy could add 12% or <span class="xn-money">USD 400 billion</span> to <span class="xn-location">India's</span> GDP<br />
- Only 47% of girls are enrolled in secondary school; each additional year of schooling for girls reduces infant mortality for their offspring by up to 10%<br />
- Workforce participation rate for Indian women is at 29%, which is far less than that of comparable economies such as <span class="xn-location">China</span> (70%), the US (66%), or <span class="xn-location">Brazil</span> (65%); <span class="xn-money">USD 56 billion</span> can be added each year to <span class="xn-location">India's</span> economy by bringing girls into the workforce<br />
- 38% of under-fives (approx. <span class="xn-money">48m</span> children) are stunted in <span class="xn-location">India</span>. Moving away from malnutrition, will add <span class="xn-money">USD 12 billion</span> a year to <span class="xn-location">India's</span> economy in terms of productivity and lower healthcare expenditure<br />
- Good news is that 95% children are now attending primary school, 88% are attending secondary school and 63% are attending senior secondary school. The numbers only increase as each year passes. However, there is a fair amount of deficit in learning outcomes</p>
<p>Considering its size and population, <span class="xn-location">India</span> has a critical role to play in achieving the SDGs. If <span class="xn-location">India</span> does not achieve these, the world will also be unable to do so. However, despite the billions of dollars that have been invested in the development sector so far, <span class="xn-location">India</span> has a long way to go for better health, education and nutrition inÂ the country. The seriousness, scale and complexity of <span class="xn-location">India's</span> problems - from rising inequality to climate change - call for collaborative action and to invest in outcome-led solutions to transform lives.</p>
<p><i>"</i><i>For us, ImpactFirst encompasses putting the interest of society as a whole in front of your own personal aspirations. Whether you are an NGO, funder, or the government </i> <i>-</i><i> push the conversation, push the agenda, and push for us to be able to hold ourselves accountable. Keep asking yourself </i> <i>-</i><i> how much am I actually changing lives?</i><i>"</i><i> said</i>Â <b><i><span class="xn-person">Deval Sanghavi</span>, </i></b> <b><i>C</i></b><b><i>o-founder, Dasra</i></b><b><i>.</i></b>Â </p>
<p><b><i>What does it mean to be ImpactFirst?</i></b>Â </p>
<p>- Putting actual lives at the forefront of conversations, strategy, planning, action and collaboration<br />
- Being problem solvers, data analysts and agents of change<br />
- Defining exactly what problemÂ one wants to solve, and mapping out howÂ one will go about solving it<br />
- Willingness to be a first mover in areas that may be considered risky or challenging and looking for new approaches to old problems<br />
- HoldingÂ oneself accountable to high standards of measuring effectiveness and success<br />
- Realizing that changing lives is a long-term investment<br />
- It implies urgency to be catalytic in one's approach to funding, programming and strategy</p>
<p>Although the nature and scale of the commitment may differ greatly for each stakeholder, they share the same mindset. They dream of an <span class="xn-location">India</span> where every individual has the opportunity to realize their potential. It is the empathy and powerful intent of each of the stakeholders that will together driveÂ to transform lives.</p>
<p>To reinforce Dasra's ImpactFirst approach, four knowledge products have been launched during the Dasra Philanthropy Week 2018.</p>
<p><b>India Philanthropy Report 2018</b>Â </p>
<p>On this day, eighth edition of Bain India Philanthropy Report 2018 was released. The report explores how philanthropists can give more effectively to optimize the impact of their giving. What's worth noting is that philanthropists profiled in this report are relatively newer to philanthropy than those showcased in the 2017 report. The report features in-depth interviews with more than 30 philanthropists, and reveals four key mindsets, which if embraced, can help givers realize their full philanthropic potential. The report marks an inspiring stage for philanthropy in <span class="xn-location">India</span>, where an increasing number of philanthropists are joining the cadre of structured and strategic philanthropy, irrespective of their quantum of giving.</p>

<p><b>Collaborative Force: Empowering 10 to 19</b>Â </p>
<p>The white paper, titled Collaborative Force: Empowering 10 to 19, urges for adaptation of collaborative models to address <span class="xn-location">India's</span> large-scale development challenges. It highlights the significance of the collaborative approach to tackling serious problems surrounding <span class="xn-location">India's</span> adolescents.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><i>A three-year initiative comes to a fruitful close - with better care for over 100,000 pregnant mothers and newborns across the Indian State</i>Â </p>
<p>Healthcare leaders and specialists across Tamil Nadu and <span class="xn-location">Singapore</span> marked the successful conclusion of a three-year collaboration between the two countries on antenatal and child healthcare in Tamil Nadu. To conclude the programme, both sides came together for a Leader's Dialogue to share their experiences and learnings over the past three years, at the Tamil Nadu Government Multi Super Specialty Hospital. TheÂ <b>Enhancing Maternal and Child Health Services (EMCH) Programme</b> is a three-year specialist programme implemented by the Singapore International Foundation (SIF) in partnership with the Department of Health and Family Welfare (DH&FW), Government of Tamil Nadu, Temasek Foundation International (TFI) and SingHealth.Â </p>
<p>Â Â Â Â  (Photo: <a href="https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/645445/Enhancing_Maternal_and_Child_Health_Services_Programme.jpg" rel="nofollow">https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/645445/Enhancing_Maternal_and_Child_Health_Services_Programme.jpg</a> )</p>
<p>Since 2015, healthcare professionals from <span class="xn-location">Singapore</span> have worked with their counterparts in three districts in Tamil Nadu - Tiruchirappalli, Kanchipuram, and Pudukkottai - to train local healthcare professionals in government healthcare institutions in Tamil Nadu to reduce infant mortality rates (IMR) and maternity mortality rates (MMR). Tamil Nadu is one of the leading states in <span class="xn-location">India</span> with an IMR of 17 against the national average of 34 and an MMR of 67 per 100,000 births. TheÂ <b>EMCH Programme</b>Â has helped augment the government's efforts to tackle preventable causes of both infant and maternal deaths, with the aim of attaining a single digit IMR and ensuring safer pregnancies for more women. These efforts also contribute towards achieving the larger UN Sustainable Development Goal 3 of Good Health and Well-Being.</p>
<p>"Having a baby is a significant phase in a woman's life and this State Government is committed to ensure that every mother should have access to quality Antenatal Services and safe confinement on par with international standards," said Dr C. Vijayabasker, Honourable Minister for Health and Family Welfare, Tamil Nadu.</p>
<p>More thanÂ <b>1,000</b>Â doctors, nurses and public health leaders and officials from Tamil Nadu have participated in the three-yearÂ <b>EMCH Programme</b>. Through pedagogy workshops, management training, dialogue sessions, symposia and a study visit to <span class="xn-location">Singapore</span> just last week, the participants had the chance to share their knowledge and experience with their counterparts from <span class="xn-location">Singapore</span>, with all parties gaining valuable insights and perspectives from the learning exchange. Among the trained pool of healthcare practitioners, 50 Master Trainers were identified and received additional training on how to cascade their knowledge to their peers in the industry.Â Â Â Â </p>
<p>As part of theÂ <b>EMCH Programme</b>, a multi-disciplinary team of 26 healthcare professionals, including obstetricians, gynaecologists, midwives, emergency paediatricians, neonatologists and allied healthcare professionals from KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH) in <span class="xn-location">Singapore</span>, shared their expertise on CORE (Combined Obstetric Resuscitations and Emergencies Training) for better management of high risk pregnancies arising from postpartum haemorrhage, eclampsia and sepsis.</p>
<p>Mr Jaryll Chan, SIF's Director of Programmes said, "At the SIF, we believe in leveraging our strengths and learning from one another to enhance the effectiveness of our programmes that enrich lives and effect positive change. I am heartened that this collaboration between the <span class="xn-location">Singapore</span> and Tamil Nadu medical communities has contributed to safer pregnancies for women and healthier babies, setting the stage for stronger friendships to grow not just between governments, but between our institutions and our people."</p>
<p>Mr <span class="xn-person">Benedict Cheong</span>, TFI's Chief Executive, said, "Good health care is an essential pillar of the economic and social development of any community. We are pleased to know that this capability-building programme has facilitated a good learning exchange between healthcare professionals from <span class="xn-location">Singapore</span> and Tamil Nadu, leading to good outcomes such as improved nursing processes and practices in the area of antenatal and postnatal care. In the long run, we hope that this will bring about better healthcare support for the community and enhance the networks of cooperation between Tamil Nadu and <span class="xn-location">Singapore</span>."</p>
<p>Professor <span class="xn-person">Ivy Ng</span>, SingHealth's Group Chief Executive Officer, said, "SingHealth is privileged to have partnered the DH&FW, Government of Tamil Nadu to share expertise in the management of high-risk pregnancies, obstetric and neonatal emergencies. This mutually beneficial collaboration has enabled both organisations to nurture a strong and sustainable pipeline of healthcare professionals to provide quality antenatal and maternal care."</p>
<p>Dr <span class="xn-person">Shephali Tagore</span>, Director, O&G International Medical Programme, and Senior Consultant, Department of Maternal Fetal Medicine, KKH, who is also SIF Specialist Team Leader in theÂ <b>EMCH Programme</b> said, "The past three years have been a great opportunity for us as healthcare providers to share our experiences - through these shared resources and expertise, we believe that we have helped play a small part in enabling safer pregnancies and deliveries in Tamil Nadu. Learning happens both ways - we too have definitely taken away insights and learnings from our Indian counterparts on their approach to maternity care and how they overcome challenges."</p>
<p>TheÂ <b>EMCH Programme</b>Â is yet another collaborative project in <span class="xn-location">India</span> in healthcare - one of the key focus areas of the SIF's work - and joins the ranks of similar maternity and child health programmes in Tamil Nadu (2009 - 2013) and Karnataka (2015 - present). It also marks another milestone in the 23-year friendship between the SIF and <span class="xn-location">India</span> to uplift lives and build enduring friendships between our people.</p>

3) 3rd Party integration and 4) Business Apps; into a Single working system that can be managed in a friendly manner.</p>
<p>The journey of Neron Informatics from being a non entity to a force to reckon within just four months time has been truly exemplary. It came into existence in the month of <span class="xn-chron">November 2018</span> and competed in the same month in Aegis Graham Bell Awards Jury round for its Innovations in Green Telecom Category for Onyx cxm IPPBX systems and in Innovative Telecom Product/Solutions for AAIKYA, an automated Telephony system in a box solution. It was not an easy task to compete with the industry bigwigs in the first instance.

<ul type="disc">
<li><i>Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad launches first-of-a-kind incubator program for fabless IC startups in <span class="xn-location">India</span></i>Â </li>
<li><i>Fabless Chip Design Incubator Program, or FabCI, has the support of Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MEITY)</i>Â </li>
<li><b><i>FabCI will incubate world-class semiconductor startups that can help accelerate change in the Indian landscape in semiconductor design</i></b>Â </li>
<li><i>Program provides remote access to facilities and software to non-<span class="xn-location">Hyderabad</span> based incubatees</i>Â </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="xn-org">Indian Institute of Technology</span> (IIT) <span class="xn-location">Hyderabad</span> has launched a first-of-its-kind incubator program focusing on creating an ecosystem for grooming startups in the area of chip design.</p>
<p>Called the <b>Fabless Chip Design Incubator Program, or FabCI</b>, it will be based in the IIT Hyderabad campus for fabless IC startups in <span class="xn-location">India</span> at their campus in <span class="xn-location">Hyderabad</span>.</p>
<p>The Fabless Chip Design Incubator is a flagship program being executed with the support of Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MEITY) and in partnership with Cadence<sup>Â®</sup>Â Design Systems, Inc., a leading provider of Electronic Design Automation (EDA) software, hardware and IP.</p>
<p>The primary motivation for this unique incubator program is to provide a one-stop solution for startups focusing in the area of chip design. The vision of this incubator is to create an ecosystem wherein the incubatees are not only provided with the relevant infrastructure, hardware and software but also are mentored through the path of success with the help of mentors who are pioneers in this field.</p>
<p>Speaking about the launch of FabCI, <b>Prof <span class="xn-person">U.B. Desai</span>, Director, IIT Hyderabad, said</b>, "This new incubator program demonstrates our commitment to generating IPR in chip design. It will be another testament to the entrepreneurial culture of the Institute."</p>
<p>"I am confident that FabCI will make great contributions to the growth of chip design in the country. This incubator program will also be a shot in the arm to the 'Make in <span class="xn-location">India</span>' campaign and help <span class="xn-location">India</span> become a global hub for chip design," <b>added Prof Desai</b>.</p>
<p>The grand vision is to leverage the deep research and design expertise of the IIT Hyderabad faculty as well as external mentorsÂ to create Indian IP and to make a mark in chip design internationally.</p>
<p>IIT Hyderabad has designated Cadence as the technology partner for FabCI. While there is a dedicated facility being established at the IIT-H campus for the incubator, remote access to Cadence's tools is available to enable semiconductor innovation and entrepreneurship irrespective of location.</p>
<p>The incubator is fully functional already and is soliciting applications from fabless IC startups.Â </p>
<p>Speaking about the partnership with IIT Hyderabad for FabCI program, <b>Mr. <span class="xn-person">Jaswinder Ahuja</span>, Corporate Vice President and Managing Director, Cadence Design Systems (<span class="xn-location">India</span>) Pvt Ltd,</b> said, "Innovation and entrepreneurship are essential for the growth of the Electronics System Design & Manufacturing (ESDM) ecosystem in <span class="xn-location">India</span>. Incubators play a catalytic role in lowering entry barriers and fostering entrepreneurship. Cadence has been working with the Government of <span class="xn-location">India</span>, industry and academia for many years now to grow the ecosystem. We are excited to partner with an esteemed institution like IIT-H for 'FabCI', a unique incubator, which we expect can provide a boost to homegrown semiconductor innovation."</p>
<p><b>Mr. <span class="xn-person">Hemant Kanakia</span>, Chief Advisor and Mentor for FabCI,</b> said, "<span class="xn-location">India</span> has an enormous potential to become a center of excellence for fabless semiconductor product and service companies. FabCI is a very good first step in realizing that potential by creating an ecosystem for startups in the semi-conductor sector. In my opinion, the success of FabCI depends on partnerships with Industries such as EDA tools, fabrication factories, Indian Electronics and Semiconductor Association and local subsidiaries of multinationals involved in design and manufacture of silicon products in <span class="xn-location">India</span>. I applaud the support of Ministry of Electronics and Information, in particular Addl. Secretary Dr. <span class="xn-person">Ajay Kumar</span> (IAS) for supporting the creation this center."</p>
<p>In addition to its world-class EDA technologies, Cadence will also provide its platforms for emulation, rapid prototyping and access to its engineering expertise to ensure success of the incubator and incubatees.</p>
